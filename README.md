# PyMathProblemGenerator

PyMathProblemGenerator is a problem generator coded in python using PyQt5 as a user interface and Wolfram Mathematica to render and compute mathematical problems.

## Installation

TBD at a later date.

## Usage

By running main.py, the user interface will appear. This requires Wolfram Mathematica to be functional. By running maindesign.py, the problem designer (not finished yet) will open, and problems can be designed and imported (not implemented yet). Instructions on this will be published soon.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Goals
Finishing the Problem designer, and making it accessible to more people who aren't familiar with the wolfram language. 

Implement a better repository storage mechanism rather than store from a local file.
